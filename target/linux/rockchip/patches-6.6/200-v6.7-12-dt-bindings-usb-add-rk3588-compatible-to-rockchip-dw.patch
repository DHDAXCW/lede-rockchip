Subject: [PATCH 12/41] dt-bindings: usb: add rk3588 compatible to
 rockchip,dwc3

RK3588 has three DWC3 controllers. Two of them are fully functional in
host, device and OTG mode including USB2 support. They are connected to
dedicated PHYs, that also support USB-C's DisplayPort alternate mode.

The third controller is connected to one of the combphy's shared
with PCIe and SATA. It can only be used in host mode and does not
support USB2. Compared to the other controllers this one needs
some extra clocks.
